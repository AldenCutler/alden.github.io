        Hey there! I'm Alden Cutler, currently a sophomore at Worcester
        Polytechnic Institute. I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in
        data science, and I'm looking for internships during the summer of 2024.
        I'm interested in full-stack web development, embedded programming, data
        science, and machine learning.
      </p>

        Outside of a professional setting, I'm a big soccer fan and I enjoy
        biking and hiking.
